Truth based on your life exeriences is not the total truth but a partial one. Universal truth is obsolute and can not change even if you differe with it. For example one might thing to solve a problem you need voilence, and for another non voilence is the vay to solve a problem.(like eye for an eye make the whole worlhjd blind)
