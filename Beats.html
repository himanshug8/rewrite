            <h1 id="meri-tibet-yatra-a-historical-fiction">Meri tibet yatra. A historical fiction.</h1>
<p>Character's Introduction:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Rahul S:</strong> A renowned writer who thinks he is an ego less,<br>
well traveled, youth inspiring, kind hearted man,
who is intellectually fit to be called a saint,<br>
goes through a series of contradictions that might disproof what he think he is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fenny M:</strong> He is a simple innocent man who lives as life unfolds before him,<br>
he is someone who can never lead, but is a great follower of the people<br>
who does great things that he could never imagine doing and rahul sanskriti is one of them,<br>
when he get the offer to follow him to Tibet, he didnâ€™t even ask if he is getting paid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gedun chophel:</strong> A Tibet monk, who practiced Buddhism from his childhood,<br>
discovered after reading western book that the act of drinking alcohol<br>
and indulging in the act of sex is equal to experiencing divine.<br>
He concludes that one should live the sensory life first.<br>
He is going to Tibet to meet his guru and to renounce his monk-hood for good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tiru and trike:</strong> A nomadic couple who lives in a tent against the backdrop of picturesque landscape.<br>
They represent the normal of the tibet culture where people can be selfish for their survival.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="beats">Beats:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Two men con a british indian constable to escape the border for tibet.</p>
<ul>
<li>They lit a small cracker to mimic a bullet sound to alert the constable.<br>
so that he checks it and they can escape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>They run and run, finally leaving behind the british india, they fall on the ground to catch their breath.<br>
they are happy that they have escaped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They heaved to their first checkpoint, heavily panting as they sink in the sunset<br>
and the chilly breeze to refill their needs for the journey<br>
and to join a Holy Lama, a dear friend of rahul, to tibet.</p>
 <!-- The lama has a pup as a parting gift for his master. -->
</li>
<li>
<p>They spent the night in the cottage, drink butter tea,<br>
before that rahul rents a black revolver and the horses with a caretaker from the cottage owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are on their journey, four horses, and a rebellious pup who wont stay on the horse with gedun,<br>
follows them with its little paws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They fight over their core ideology, and fenny feels humbled before the concepts they were talking about<br>
and he feels good just to be included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They stay shut till evening when fenny discovers in the way<br>
that a herd of sheep is fenced beautifully against the backdrop of tinted blue mountains outline by the falling sun.<br>
Fenny wants to click a picture where as rahul asks him that they have to pass the snowland before the light goes out,<br>
but gendu differs that he should do whatever his mind tells him to do.<br>
Fenny leaps off , unhooks his camera off the walking horse.<br>
The horseman doesn't stop because the horses were trained in such a way<br>
that they only stop for the checkpoint to eat for better travel experience.<br>
so they leave fenny in hope that he will catch up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fenny mesmerized by the view click pictures that are black and white, he is dissatisfied the limitations of the b/w <br> camera, when a bullet passes through his arm, sprinkling the blood out, the sound echos and the herd goes crazy.<br> Fenny escapes with a loose arm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has to ascend the snowy hill with a loose, numb arm, which he does, barely,<br> but a blizzard is on and its more of a death wish to even move a single step but fenny goes down and falls with a thump on the snow ground.<br> Before him is a vast land of snow and far far away he can se a light before he goes unconscious.</p>
</li>
</ol>
