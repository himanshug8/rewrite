## Beats:
1. Two men con a british indian constable to escape the border for tibet.
   * They lit a small cracker to mimic a bullet sound to alert the constable.  
     so that he checks it and they can escape.

2. They run and run, finally leaving behind the british india, they fall on the ground to catch their breath.  
   they are happy that they have escaped.

3. They heaved to their first checkpoint, heavily panting as they sink in the sunset  
    and the chilly breeze to refill their needs for the journey  
    and to join a Holy Lama, a dear friend of rahul, to tibet.
    <!-- The lama has a pup as a parting gift for his master. -->

4. They spent the night in the cottage, drink butter tea,  
    before that rahul rents a black revolver and the horses with a caretaker from the cottage owner.

5. They are on their journey, four horses, and a rebellious pup who wont stay on the horse with gedun,  
    follows them with its little paws.

6. They fight over their core ideology, and fenny feels humbled before the concepts they were talking about  
    and he feels good just to be included.

7. They stay shut till evening when fenny discovers in the way  
that a herd of sheep is fenced beautifully against the backdrop of tinted blue mountains outline by the falling sun.  
Fenny wants to click a picture where as rahul asks him that they have to pass the snowland before the light goes out,  
 but gendu differs that he should do whatever his mind tells him to do.  
 Fenny leaps off , unhooks his camera off the walking horse.  
The horseman doesn't stop because the horses were trained in such a way  
that they only stop for the checkpoint to eat for better travel experience.   
so they leave fenny in hope that he will catch up.
