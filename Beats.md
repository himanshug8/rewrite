# Meri tibet yatra. A historical fiction.

### THE CONCEPT WE ARE EXPLORING:

 Different set of experiences lead you to different set of truths. For example:
 DOES GOD EXIST?  
 `For some it does.` `for some it doesn't` ` and for some god has a totally different meaning`  
 And we see all kinds of conflict between people with different set of truths.

 [**INFO DUMP:** every species that exist on this planet is SELFISH, because if you are not selfish you cant survive.  
  eg: guinea pig.
 The plants, The trees. they depend on humans and animals for co2 and we are dependent on them of o2.

HUMANS: WE became conscious. We looked up and wondered. We are intelligent, so our survival is done. survival = selfish.
conscious = intelligence.]

 #### So, my question is,
  is their a truth that is absolute, which is common for everyone. for eg.
  * We are on a rounded planet which is revolving around the sun. <br> and their are billion of stars and planets before us in the night sky<br> and beyond our beloved earth their is unforgiving cold space which can swallow us at any moment, but didn't. <br> or a truth as simple as, this is a dog who barks.<br> this is unchanging and a total fact.
   
   Through this film we are exploring `the nature of truth` and we are questioning,   
    are we allowed to perceive a truth which is unchanging or absolute,  
     or we are bound to have fragmented truths and the conflict will never end......???

## Beats:
1. Two men con a british indian constable to escape the border for tibet.
   * They lit a small cracker to mimic a bullet sound to alert the constable.  
     so that he checks it and they can escape.

2. They run and run, finally leaving behind the british india, they fall on the ground to catch their breath.  
   they are happy that they have escaped.

3. They heaved to their first checkpoint, A cottage, heavily panting as they sink in the sunset. 
    and the chilly breeze. They are here to refill their needs for the journey  
    and to join a Holy Lama, a dear friend of rahul, to tibet.
    <!-- The lama has a pup as a parting gift for his master. -->

    follows them with its little paws.

6. They fight over their core ideology, and fenny feels humbled before the concepts they were talking about  
    and he feels good just to be included.

7. They stay shut till evening when fenny discovers in the way  
that a herd of sheep is fenced beautifully against the backdrop of tinted blue mountains outline by the falling sun.  
Fenny wants to click a picture where as rahul asks him that they have to pass the snow land before the light goes out,  
 but gendu differs that he should do whatever his mind tells him to do.  
 Fenny leaps off the walking horse, pace along to unhooks his camera.
The horseman doesn't stop because the horses were trained in such a way  
that they only stop for the checkpoint to eat for better travel experience.   
so they leave fenny in hope that he will catch up.  

8. Fenny mesmerized by the view click pictures that are black and white, he is dissatisfied the limitations of the b/w <br> camera, when a bullet passes through his arm, sprinkling the blood out, the sound echos and the herd goes crazy.<br> Fenny escapes with a loose arm.

9. He has to ascend the snowy hill with a loose, numb arm, which he does, barely,<br> but a blizzard is on and its more of a death wish to even move a single step but fenny goes down and falls with a thump on the snow ground.<br> Before him is a vast land of snow and far far away he can se a light before he goes unconscious.

10. Rahul and gedun with horses, intense faces, snowy blizzard slitting across everything. They found a cave.
11. rahul tries to light the bonfire with the help of the horse man, using a vintage lighter.

15. next day, with bruises on his face fenny discover a colorful tent far away. Which belongs to a nomad couple lives off illegally hunting animals. They are helpful to our men, and we get to know that gedun is going to renounce his monkhood in tibet to live a sensory life. while preparing meat trike removes her upper wear and sits bare chested, which seems to make our men awkward but they soon discover that in tibet the breasts are just a normal body part and its not taboo to be bare chested for women. fenny clicks a photograph as he finds this cultural openness meaningful.
16. After leaving the nomad tent, in the way when rahul is looking over his shoulder to look at the small puppy, his horse trudges and rahul falls off it hard on the dirt breaking a arm. thank god its his left arm otherwise this trip will come to an end.
17. In the evening they hide in a groove where the horseman feeds off his horses and rahul is feeling inspired and want all the young people to follow his trail of excellence and should travel the world, when gedun checks his bag and scolds rahul as a big portion of the food is missing and that the nomad couple must have stolen it. And to justify rahul says that he already felt that the bag was heavy and the couple seemed nice. but gedun further scolds him and rahul decides that he will not eat till they reaches the next town.
