# Meri tibet yatra. A historical fiction.

### THE CONCEPT WE ARE EXPLORING:

 Different set of experiences lead you to different set of truths. For example:
 DOES GOD EXIST?  
 `For some it does.` `for some it doesn't` ` and for some god has a totally different meaning`  
 And we see all kinds of conflict between people with different set of truths.

 [**INFO DUMP:** every species that exist on this planet is SELFISH, because if you are not selfish you cant survive.  
  eg: guinea pig.
 The plants, The trees. they depend on humans and animals for co2 and we are dependent on them of o2.

HUMANS: WE became conscious. We looked up and wondered. We are intelligent, so our survival is done. survival = selfish.
conscious = intelligence.]

 #### So, my question is,
  is their a truth that is absolute, which is common for everyone. for eg.
  * We are on a rounded planet which is revolving around the sun. <br> and their are billion of stars and planets before us in the night sky<br> and beyond our beloved earth their is unforgiving cold space which can swallow us at any moment, but didn't. <br> or a truth as simple as, this is a dog who barks.<br> this is unchanging and a total fact.
   
   Through this film we are exploring `the nature of truth` and we are questioning,   
    are we allowed to perceive a truth which is unchanging or absolute,  
     or we are bound to have fragmented truths and the conflict will never end......???

## Beats:

   * They lit a small cracker to mimic a bullet sound to alert the constable.  
     so that he checks it and they can escape.

2. They run and run, finally leaving behind the british india, they fall on the ground to catch their breath.  
   they are happy that they have escaped.

3. They heaved to their first checkpoint, A cottage, heavily panting as they sink in the sunset. 
    and the chilly breeze. They are here to refill their needs for the journey  
    and to join a Holy Lama, a dear friend of rahul, to tibet.
    <!-- The lama has a pup as a parting gift for his master. --> 

4. They spent the night in the cottage, drink butter tea,  
    before that rahul rents a black revolver and the horses with a caretaker from the cottage owner.

5. They are on their journey, four horses, and a rebellious pup who wont stay on the horse with gedun,  
    follows them with its little paws.

6. They fight over their core ideology, and fenny feels humbled before the concepts they were talking about  
    and he feels good just to be included.

7. They stay shut till evening when fenny discovers in the way  
that a herd of sheep is fenced beautifully against the backdrop of tinted blue mountains outline by the falling sun.  
Fenny wants to click a picture where as rahul asks him that they have to pass the snow land before the light goes out,  
 but gendu differs that he should do whatever his mind tells him to do.  
 Fenny leaps off the walking horse, pace along to unhooks his camera.
The horseman doesn't stop because the horses were trained in such a way  
that they only stop for the checkpoint to eat for better travel experience.   
so they leave fenny in hope that he will catch up.  

8. Fenny mesmerized by the view click pictures that are black and white, he is dissatisfied the limitations of the b/w <br> camera, when a bullet passes through his arm, sprinkling the blood out, the sound echos and the herd goes crazy.<br> Fenny escapes with a loose arm.

9. He has to ascend the snowy hill with a loose, numb arm, which he does, barely,<br> but a blizzard is on and its more of a death wish to even move a single step but fenny goes down and falls with a thump on the snow ground.<br> Before him is a vast land of snow and far far away he can se a light before he goes unconscious.

10. Rahul and gedun with horses, intense faces, snowy blizzard slitting across everything. They found a cave.
11. rahul tries to light the bonfire with the help of the horse man, using a vintage lighter.
12. We find fenny, snow covered, still as dead. A hawk cries somewhere, the sound is frail but comes affront<br> piercing everything, even the blizzard that fenny shrikes and looks up to find a deer partially visible.
13. He manages to follow him, and by the grace of the god he reached close enough to his friends, that they can hear him scream.
14. gedun and rahun aids him to comfort, thinking what a lucky motherfucker. they spent the night eating sattu and drinking tea.
15. next day, with bruises on his face fenny discover a colorful tent far away. Which belongs to a nomad couple lives off illegally hunting animals. They are helpful to our men, and we get to know that gedun is going to renounce his monkhood in tibet to live a sensory life. while preparing meat trike removes her upper wear and sits bare chested, which seems to make our men awkward but they soon discover that in tibet the breasts are just a normal body part and its not taboo to be bare chested for women. fenny clicks a photograph as he finds this cultural openness meaningful.
16. After leaving the nomad tent, in the way when rahul is looking over his shoulder to look at the small puppy, his horse trudges and rahul falls off it hard on the dirt breaking a arm. thank god its his left arm otherwise this trip will come to an end.
17. In the evening they hide in a groove where the horseman feeds off his horses and rahul is feeling inspired and want all the young people to follow his trail of excellence and should travel the world, when gedun checks his bag and scolds rahul as a big portion of the food is missing and that the nomad couple must have stolen it. And to justify rahul says that he already felt that the bag was heavy and the couple seemed nice. but gedun further scolds him and rahul decides that he will not eat till they reaches the next town.
18. rahul encounters a cheetah when he was asleep on duty, we don't know if it was a dream or reality. Any way next day fenny discovers a group of cheetahs. after a few days of struggle.
19. they reaches an open cave which leads to a town far away, but gedun alerts them that it might be a miraj, but rahul who has eaten nothing fights him to leave but with a tinker of magic and the clasping of the hands make the town vanish before their eyes and rahul not believing what he saw, walks with gedun silently.

<!-- NOte: tirki, tirhi spelling error. -->
<!-- Note: ad the horse man.... he is the managar of the horses and their feeding. -->

<!-- 14th oct. -->
<!-- page 23_incomplete v.o_ tibet ke log. -->

<!-- Page no 32. first town. -->
<!-- (Important thing to note.) -->
<!-- Truth based on your life exeriences is not the total truth but a partial one. Universal truth is obsolute and can not change even if you differe with it. For example one might thing to solve a problem you need voilence, and for another non voilence is the vay to solve a problem.(like eye for an eye make the whole world blind) -->

20. the dog is tired and is now easy to handel as rahul grabs him with his working arm for the journey.
21. At night they setup a camp at the popular site of a land slide that happened a century ago, rahul cant sleep with a roaring stomach. gedun is on the watch taking his tea, and fenny dreams the death of the 7th dalai lama, and an absurd ritual attached to it. On inquiring about the dream, which felt really real, gedun told him what he saw was not a dream but a memory of a deceased person who died upon this land slide.
22. Next day the dog is not able to walk or even breath properly, they all know that he is going to be dead. gedun and fenny leaves where rahul is sobbing and he uses his share of tent, tear it apart and use it to codver the dead body of the dog and place it underneath a sturdy rock formation. upon ascending the hill, he find them sipping tea. He joins them.
<!-- (add a scene here, where a donkey caring the food for horses falls off the cliff and they left him alive their who is screaming in pain, that what they are going to do when the dog is not able body) -->
23. heaving through the dry mountains, they finally encounter a troop carrying sacred buddhist documents, upon asking they get to know that the documents are off limits, but the magic of money can bypass any sacredness anywhere if you push enough. but nothing of use is found. so, initial disappointment, and loosing money.
24. fenny by now is curious and we get to know that if rahul dies fenny is not been able to complete his work, where as gedun can but he doesn't want to, because he thinks that anything worth having will exist no matter the time. he gives an example that air is need to live, it can never run out, but a book is so fragile that it can burn or eaten by insects. 
25. They reach their first town, where a beast of a local dog chased them, when they plunge in someone's house for safety. After initial tit-bit, they settle at the same place for the night. Rahul finally have his meal, and he eats like a beast.
26. tomorrow afternoon the family and our men according to the ritual take bath together in the river,obviously naked and nothing weird about it. They get to know that they take bath only once  a year.
<!-- from line 1280 awkward, the dialogue where fenny describes the beauty of the being -->
<!-- line no, 1312 ------ copy from book, old man's death.
 -->
 27. Finally they see people on the pilgrimage and while joining them, they find an old man lying dry underneath a rock formation, who asks for water and  gedun's blessing, and he does give watering his illusion when he dies with a smile.
 28. they walk and walk and walk,till night the set up a camp with raised tent finally and a comforting bonfire. when they encounter a spirit couple who wants to know them who they are, but we only hear their voice, fenny and rahul shitting their pants where gedun deals with them.
 29. understand the scene from the book. where gedun uses his woodo bullshit to manipulate them into taking care for the kid. (other wise, the pilgrimage is so sacred that they can left anyone behind as if one dies on the pilgrimage, it considered that the person goes to heaven)
 30. they met with an old couple who ladens their luggage on a frail goat, which escapes when our men greeted them and asked them to go easy on the goat. but it takes off, fenny follows it to catch it, but rolls down the rocky hill and his back smashes on a pointy rock. something breaks down and he cries in pain. 
 31. gedun after manipulating the old couple into believing that that goat is his father born again as it. so that they will take care for it till lahsa.
 32. rahul and gedun attend fenny, who surely has broken something, they laden him on his horse back. where fenny screams in pain.
 33. they slit through dry chilly lands, fenny is visibly in pain.
 34. when, finally they get to see the top part of the POTLA PALACE.
 35. they are at the entrance, where the tibet officials catches a german man pretending to be a bagger, they throw him out. but because gedun is with them, the have a save passage.
 36. after having diner and sleeping next day, a healing lama and his assistant perform a ritual and apply some herbal medicine on to his back and ties him tight to adjust his spine. finally rahul gets the permission form the dalai lama to explorer tibet and do as he pleases.(he gets the permission because dalai lama loves india and because their god comes from that place)
 37. When rahul give the healing lama their payment he gets to know that fenny is not going to live long, they have given gyasto a herbal tea which will help with the pain.

38. ***Montage***:-  
    * Gyasto leads him to a temple with a golden buddha statue, rahul manically searches for his documents where gyasto sips tea with the appointed llama in the temple.
    * Another temple where the wall looking heap of books, mingled with mud and a living place of maggots triggers rahul and he scolds the working lama. But finds that the lama thinks that the books are buddha itself so they pray to them. which makes rahul really angry.   
    * gedun scene: A shiny, spiritual, red room with equally shiny floor, gedun talks with his master. Who has no problem him quitting the monkhood, but he asks him to wait till his friend(fenny) gets better, and he asks him to bring him back here, then he can quit his monkhood.
    * on the third temple rahul meets a drunk lama, who sits and drinks all day to mimic calmness. but here he find some documents but not the one he is looking for. they slept their for the night, in the morning they pay for the documents and leave. 
    * Dharamveer temple: he cries because this is the guy who promoted buddhism to tibet.
